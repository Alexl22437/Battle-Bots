#Started research on NHRL and 3LB robots **Total Time spent: 2h**

After learning about Hackclub Highway, I have started to work towards my goal of building a Beetle weight battle bot. This idea came to mind months ago before halting my research due to other robotic competitions I have been involved in. During my time, today I had researched bots to give me inspiration for my robot. I've landed a final decision to do a vertical spinner with two separate blades, inspired by the Peter Bar Kit and one of the best bots, Lynx. After finding a bot to get inspired from, I looked into registration and events I could compete in.
