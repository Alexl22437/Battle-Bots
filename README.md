# Cheddar Shredder V2

## What is my project?
My project for Hackclub High way is a basic lynx inspired battle bot that will compete under the NHRL 3lb beetle weight class. With various known parts in the community I was able to put together a strong robot that will destroy anything in the arena.

## Why did I make this?
I am a student that is inspired by engineering, I come from a team in my school that competes under the First Tech Challenge competition hosted by FIRST. I have done a lot of cad over my high school years leading to my mostly experienced talet for engineering and mechanical. After regional champs for FTC, I was bored, I had nothing to do. I had talent for CAD and I wanted to do something that will keep me busy until the next season came, thats when I laid my eyes on NHRL. I was scrolling through my feed sometime during a random night when I stumbled upon a video of two robots fighting and I wondered to my self: How can I get involved? So I researched with my friend who had some prior experience to NHRL, and as the remainder of the year went on I started learning and seeing how people build their bots. But when I went to see the cost, it costed around 500 for a decent bot! Thats when I learned about hackclub highway, so I decided to spend half of my summer making and building a bot to which I would compete in NHRL around October.
